Introduction: The KaggleX BIPOC Mentorship Program helps to "... increase representation, further career opportunities, and develop growth for individuals who identify as BIPOC (Black, Indigenous, People of Color) in the data science industry".Selected participants are paired with a mentor who has been in the field for at least five years. At the end of the program they complete their final showcase project to show the skills they have worked on during the program. The final project can be in the form of a blog post, viedo presentation, code, etc.

Problem Statement: As someone who is transitioning into the data field from a non-technical background, I wanted to look at what some of the top programming languages are out there. The project aimed to analyze data from Kaggle of programming lanaguages used on GitHub and determine the top programming lanagauages on the platform. Additionally, I wanted to visualize the information and build an unsupervised machine learning model with the data to detemine which languages I should focus on during my trantion into data.
